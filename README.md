My take on Andrew Ng's great [Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN&index=1) couse.

This is a project where I'll be developing ML solutions from scratch (no
algebra / ML libraries used) in Rust.
My goal is to learn about how ML works on a deep level.
In addition, I also want to improve my Test-Driven Development and Rust
skillset.

The solutions in this project serve as an example, and are probably not the
most correct or efficient solution to the problem. It could be more easy to
understand than other implementations, given this is written by someone with
little practical experience in machine learning.

## Lecture 1-4

I have implemented a Matrix struct that represents a linear algebra matrix.
It has methods for addition, multiplication, inversion amongst other
fundamental operators.

I'm currently working on solving the multivariate linear regression problem.
The gradient descent approach has yet to be implemented. The normal equation
method will probably be trivial to implement, given that matrix inversion is
already implemented.
